#+TITLE: Optimization

* What is optimization
- Make better decision

* Tool
- Linear Programming
- Robust linear optimization: an optimziation technique that guards you against
  parameter fluctutation. Parameters fluctuation natrually since the data you
  get is always from sampling a small amount of samples. This is known as
  *knightian uncertainty*
- Ofcourse: there's another kind of uncertainty which is *risk*!! This is called
  stoachastic unvertainty

** Simplex Algorithm:
- an algorithm that finds the optimal solution to the linear optimization problem.
- I.e finds the vertex that maximizes target.

** Convex set and convex function


** Integer problem
- All problem variables are integers
- Binary integer problem: solution is either 0 or 1

** Relaxation
- Find the problem that provides the lower bound to the current one
- Example: linear relaxation from integer problem to liear one
- Example: Lagrandian relaxation: Lagrangian multiplier
*** Equivlance
- If the relatex problem's solution could be transformed back to the optimal
  solution of the unrelaxed one.
- Could be checked if A is relaxation of B and B is a relaxation of A.
